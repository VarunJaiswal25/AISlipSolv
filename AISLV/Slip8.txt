Q.1) Write a Python program to accept a string. Find and print the number of upper case alphabets and lower case alphabets.



def count_upper_lower(string):
    upper_count = 0
    lower_count = 0

    for char in string:
        if char.isupper():
            upper_count += 1
        elif char.islower():
            lower_count += 1

    print("Number of uppercase alphabets:", upper_count)
    print("Number of lowercase alphabets:", lower_count)

# Taking input from the user
user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# Calling the function to count uppercase and lowercase alphabets
count_upper_lower(user_input)



Q.2) Write a Python program to solve tic-tac-toe problem


def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" | ".join(row))
        print("-" * 9)

            return True
    if all(board[i][i] == player for i in range(3)) or all(board[i][2 - i] == player for i in range(3)):
        return True
    return False

    while True:
        print_board(board)

        row = int(input(f"Player {current_player}, enter the row (0, 1, or 2): "))
        col = int(input(f"Player {current_player}, enter the column (0, 1, or 2): "))

        if board[row][col] == ' ':
            board[row][col] = current_player
            if check_winner(board, current_player):
                print_board(board)
                print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
                break
            elif is_board_full(board):
                print_board(board)
                print("It's a draw!")
                break
            else:
                current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'
        else:
            print("Cell already taken. Try again.")
