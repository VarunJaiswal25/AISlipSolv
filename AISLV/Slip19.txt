Q.1) Write a program to implement Hangman game using python.
Description:
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. The user should guess the word correctly by
entering alphabets of the user choice. The Program will get input as single alphabet from the
user and it will matchmaking with the alphabets in the original word.


import random

def choose_word():
    # List of words for the game
    words = ["hangman", "python", "programming", "developer", "computer", "challenge"]
    return random.choice(words)

def display_word(word, guessed_letters):
    # Display the word with guessed letters and underscores for unguessed letters
    display = ""
    for letter in word:
        if letter in guessed_letters:
            display += letter + " "
        else:
            display += "_ "
    return display.strip()

def hangman():
    print("Welcome to Hangman!")
    
    # Choose a random word for the game
    secret_word = choose_word()
    
    # Set up variables
    guessed_letters = []
    attempts_left = 6  # Number of attempts allowed

    while attempts_left > 0:
        print("\n" + display_word(secret_word, guessed_letters))
        
        # Ask the user to guess a letter
        guess = input("Enter a letter: ").lower()

        # Check if the guess is a valid single letter
        if len(guess) != 1 or not guess.isalpha():
            print("Please enter a valid single letter.")
            continue

        # Check if the letter has already been guessed
        if guess in guessed_letters:
            print("You already guessed that letter. Try again.")
            continue

        # Add the guessed letter to the list
        guessed_letters.append(guess)

        # Check if the guessed letter is in the word
        if guess not in secret_word:
            attempts_left -= 1
            print(f"Incorrect guess! {attempts_left} attempts left.")
        
        # Check if the player has guessed all the letters
        if set(guessed_letters) == set(secret_word):
            print("Congratulations! You guessed the word:", secret_word)
            break

    if attempts_left == 0:
        print("Sorry, you ran out of attempts. The correct word was:", secret_word)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hangman()
